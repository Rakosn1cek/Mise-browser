# Overview & Philosophy

Mise Browser is a personal, keyboard-centric web browser designed specifically for low-power and fanless Linux systems.

Typical desktop browsers consume gigabytes of memory across dozens of background processes, producing heat and throttling on fanless hardware. Mise provides an ultra-lean browsing environment by stripping away unnecessary browser overhead while delivering modern privacy isolation, multi-account containers, and complete mouse-free operation.

## Design Principles

- **Keyboard First**: Every single feature, tab switch, link click, and setting can be reached without touching a mouse.
- **Resource Respect**: Idle tabs hibernate and detach completely from memory, keeping fanless systems cool and responsive.
- **Strict Privacy Isolation**: Workspaces operate in isolated container partitions. Work and personal profiles never leak cookies or storage.
- **Air-Gapped Security**: Untrusted scripts and shell commands are never blindly executed; they pass through clipboard verification.
- **Distro & Shell Agnostic**: Fully integrated with Arch Linux and native terminal emulators while functioning seamlessly across all environments.

## Architecture at a Glance

Mise combines the rendering capabilities of Chromium with Electron and native system utilities:

1. **Main Process (`main.js`)**: Manages window lifecycles, memory pressure monitoring, partition isolation, native configurations, and keybinding translation.
2. **Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)**: Powers the vertical tab sidebar, overlays, link hints, notes, and user interface.
3. **Webview Partitions (`modules/webview.js`)**: Renders individual web pages inside sandboxed `<webview>` tags assigned to specific workspace container partitions.
4. **Local Configuration (`~/.config/mise-browser/`)**: Human-readable JSON files and Markdown notes stored safely in your home directory.
