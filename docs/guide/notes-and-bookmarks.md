# Notes, Bookmarks & Quickmarks

Mise incorporates productivity utilities directly into the browser, saving all data as plain text and JSON files in your local user configuration directory.

## Markdown Quick Notes (`Ctrl + N`)

Mise includes an integrated scratchpad overlay for taking notes alongside your research:

- Press **Ctrl + N** to open or close the Notes overlay.
- Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax.
- **Editing Mode**: Click into the textarea to write notes.
- **Instant Persistence**: All notes are automatically saved to:
  ```text
  ~/.config/mise-browser/notes.md
  ```
- Because notes are stored in a standard Markdown file, you can view or edit them outside Mise using Neovim, Obsidian, or any external text editor.

The Bookmarks overlay allows you to manage saved links with full keyboard navigation:

- Press **Ctrl + Shift + B** to toggle the Bookmarks Manager.
- **Add Bookmark**: Press **Ctrl + Shift + A** while viewing any page to save the current URL into your bookmarks collection.
- **Fuzzy Search**: Start typing inside the overlay to filter bookmarks dynamically.
- **Open Bookmark**: Use the arrow keys to highlight a bookmark and press **Enter** to open it.
- **Delete Bookmark**: Highlight a bookmark and press **Delete** to remove it from your collection.
- Bookmarks are stored in:

  ```

## Quickmarks (Single-Key Fast Jump)

Quickmarks provide instantaneous, single-key bookmarking inspired by Vim and window managers:

### 1. Setting a Quickmark
- While on any page, press **Ctrl + Shift + Q**.
- An indicator prompt asks for a key binding.
- Press any single alphanumeric key (for example, `g` for GitHub or `r` for Reddit).
- The current URL is permanently bound to that key.

### 2. Jumping to a Quickmark
- From anywhere in the browser, press **Ctrl + J**.
- Press the assigned letter key (e.g. `g`).
- Mise instantly navigates your active tab to the bound URL.

Quickmarks are saved in:
```text
~/.config/mise-browser/quickmarks.json
```

## Actionable History Overlay (`Ctrl + Shift + H`)

- Press **Ctrl + Shift + H** to open the History overlay.
- Search through your browsing history in real time.
- Press **Enter** on any result to open the page.
- Click **Purge History** to wipe all stored history records from `history.json`.
