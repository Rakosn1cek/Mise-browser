# Privacy & Trusted Sites

Mise is engineered to provide strong privacy defaults while ensuring that modern web applications, banking portals, and checkout flows work without artificial roadblocks.

## Native Tracker & Ad Blocking

Mise integrates an in-process network request blocker powered by Ghostery's block engine:

- Blocks known marketing trackers, advertising networks, and telemetry collectors natively before outbound network requests leave the browser.
- Operates at the network intercept layer, conserving CPU cycles and network bandwidth on slow or metered connections.
- Requires no external extensions or third-party web store plugins.

## Global Private Browsing (`Ctrl + Shift + P`)

For volatile browsing sessions where no trace should remain:

- Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** to toggle Private Browsing Mode.
- All new navigation routes through an in-memory profile partition (`MisePrivateProfile`).
- Cookies, cache files, and site storage created during private mode are wiped completely when the session ends or when the browser closes.

## Trusted Sites (Online Banking & Shopping)

Modern online banks, Google authentication, and e-commerce sites (such as Amazon or checkout payment gateways) employ sophisticated anti-fraud algorithms. When a browser randomises fingerprints, alters user-agent client hints, or strips verification headers, fraud systems flag the session as suspicious and block logins or payments.

Mise resolves this through the **Trusted Sites** architecture:

- **Shield Indicator**: Every tab in the vertical sidebar features a shield button.
  - **Shield Active (Half Shield)**: Full protection, tracker blocking, and strict isolation are active.
  - **Shield Down (Full Shield)**: The domain is in your Trusted Sites list. Fraud detection signals are kept intact to ensure seamless logins and payment processing.
- **One-Click Whitelisting**: Click the shield icon in any sidebar tab to toggle trust status for that domain immediately. Mise updates your configuration and reloads the tab.
- **Managing Trusted Domains**: In Preferences (**F1** or **Ctrl + H**), open the **Trusted Sites** text area. Enter one domain per line (e.g. `amazon.co.uk`, `accounts.google.com`). All subdomains are covered automatically without requiring a browser restart.

## Active Site Data Clearing

When debugging web applications or purging lingering sessions:

1. Open **Preferences** (**F1** or **Ctrl + H**) and navigate to **Privacy & Protection**.
2. **Clear Site Cookies**: Surgically deletes cookies specifically matching the active tab's domain without logging you out of unrelated sites in other tabs.
3. **Clear Cache**: Flushes the local Chromium disk and memory cache.
