## Why Mise Browser?

Most modern web browsers consume gigabytes of memory, leak telemetry continuously, and expect a pointing device for every interaction. **Mise** takes a fundamentally different path: it treats web navigation as a keyboard-centric, distraction-free environment designed to respect both your hardware and your privacy.

::: tip ARCHITECTURAL PILLARS
* **Memory Conservation:** Idle tabs detach from DOM memory. Twenty tabs take the RAM footprint of two.
* **Complete Isolation:** Separate workspace containers keep cookies, caches, and logins entirely segregated.
* **Transparent Storage:** Configuration, notes, history, and keybinds live in human-readable files under `~/.config/mise-browser/`.
* **Zero Cloud Dependence:** No remote telemetry, no forced account sync, and zero phone-home profiling.

| `Ctrl + 1` to `9` | Workspace Jump | Switch between isolated multi-account containers |
| `Ctrl + L` / `o` | Omnibar | Open floating address bar with search engine aliases |
| `Ctrl + Shift + H` | History Overlay | Search, reopen, or purge visited history records |
| `Alt + N` | Scratchpad | Open Markdown quick-notes scratchpad |

## Quick Start on Linux

Download the self-contained Linux AppImage from GitHub Releases and run directly on any distribution:

```bash
# Make executable and launch
chmod +x Mise-*-x86_64.AppImage
./Mise-*-x86_64.AppImage

## Built with Modern Open-Source Foundations

Mise combines the battle-tested rendering speed of Chromium and Electron with custom modular subsystems written in vanilla JavaScript:

* **Ghostery Network Engine:** Local request filtering without third-party extension overhead.
* **safeStorage Encryption:** Linux `libsecret`, macOS Keychain, and Windows DPAPI hardware-backed encryption for persistent cookies.
* **inotify Live Reloading:** Instant injection and live reloading of local `.user.js` and `.user.css` user customisations.
* **Debounced Persistence:** Asynchronous disk flushing to prevent main-process stutter on single-page web applications.
