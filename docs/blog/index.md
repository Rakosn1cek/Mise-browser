Each chronicle follows the development anatomy: **Problem** → **Attempted Solution** → **The Bug / Fail** → **The Architectural Fix**.

### [The "Zero-RAM" Tab Hibernation Myth: Why Sleeping Tabs Still Cost 40-90MB](./tab-hibernation-zero-ram-myth.md)

How chasing zero memory usage broke tabs with the `about:blank` amnesia trap, why Chromium partition sessions retain 40-90MB of RAM, and the pragmatic unmounting architecture that slashed memory bloat safely.

### Upcoming Chronicles

- **The Ghostery IPC Civil War: Adblocking Across Isolated Partitions**  
  How strict multi-account container partitions caused IPC channel collisions in the adblocking engine and the session detachment fix that resolved it.

- **Taming the Userscript Engine: SSRF and DNS Rebinding Defences**  
  Closing critical security holes in `GM_xmlhttpRequest` by enforcing `@connect` rules, private IP blocking, and pre-resolution socket pinning.

- **The Ghost in the CSS: Tracking Pixels in Reader View**  
  How inline CSS background images and SVG containers bypassed DOM distillation and how strict sanitisation closed the leak.
